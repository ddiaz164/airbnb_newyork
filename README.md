# New York City Airbnb Listings: Predicting the Price
New York City is the nationâ€™s largest short-term rental market and it is the largest domestic market for Airbnb with over 50,000 apartment rental listings. However, Airbnb does not permit hosts to have more than one listing at any single address in New York City so each listing pertains to one unique address. 
## Data Source
I found the data I used on Kaggle, it describes about ten different listing activities and metrics for New York City in 2019 and it has almost 50,000 listings to look at. Since each listing belongs to a unique address, the location metrics contained in the data set would prove very beneficial in a model.
## Data Preparation
As a pleasant surprise, the dataset came mostly clean with only a few columns having NaNs and they were very easy to fill according to their values. The reviews and reviews per month seemed to have NaNs when the listing had not been reviewed yet so those I filled with 0, and the name/host name columns have some NaNs so those I filled with 'Unknown'.
## Initial Lookthrough
The first thing I wanted to do was to take a look at how these listings were distributed across the city.

I found that most of these were in the Manhattan and Brooklyn area and a small number of them in Bronx and Staten Island.
